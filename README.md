                <br>With my analytical skills and proactive approach, I am confident in my ability to develop and implement solutions. Currently, I am working on a personal project that utilizes the technologies of Spring Boot, React.js, and PostgreSQL. This project serves as an opportunity for me to put my learning into practice and further develop my skills as a software developer.<br><br>
                I am actively pursuing my goal of becoming a skilled software developer. In my short-term plan, I aim to master .NET Core and achieve a strong command of JavaScript. Currently, I am focused on studying data structures and algorithms as a key aspect of my overall development.<br><br>
               As a detail-oriented, responsible, and dedicated engineer, I bring a strong work ethic and a commitment to delivering high-quality products on time. I possess a self-motivated and quick-learning mindset, constantly striving to improve my skills and abilities.
